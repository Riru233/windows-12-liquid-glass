          Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license
          agreement between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software
          installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
          and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a
          business, where your principal place of business is located, one of
          its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer.
          Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft
          or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you
          acquired the software directly from Microsoft. If you are a volume
          license customer, use of this software is subject to your volume
          license agreement rather than this agreement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This agreement describes your rights, obligations, and the conditions
          upon which you may use the Windows software. You should review the
          entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that
          accompany the software and any linked terms, because all of the terms
          are important and together create this agreement that applies to you.
          You can review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a
          browser window.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of
          these terms, and consent to the transmission of certain information
          during activation and during your use of the software as per the
          privacy statement described in Section 3. If you do not accept and
          comply with these terms, you may not use the software or its features.
          You may contact the device manufacturer or installer, or your retailer
          if you purchased the software directly, to determine its return policy
          and return the software or device for a refund or credit under that
          policy. You must comply with that policy, which might require you to
          return the software with the entire device on which the software is
          installed for a refund or credit, if any.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <h3>a. Applicability</h3>
        <p>
          This agreement applies to the Windows software that is preinstalled on
          your device, or acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the
          media on which you received the software (if any), any fonts, icons,
          images or sound files included with the software, and also any
          Microsoft updates, upgrades, supplements or services for the software,
          unless other terms come with them. It also applies to Windows apps
          developed by Microsoft that provide functionality such as mail,
          calendar, contacts, music and news that are included with Windows,
          unless other terms apply. If this agreement contains terms regarding a
          feature or service not available on your device, those terms do not
          apply.
        </p>

        <h3>b. Additional terms</h3>
        <p>
          Additional Microsoft and third-party terms may apply to your use of
          certain features, services and apps, depending on your device’s
          capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it. Please read
          them.
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online
            services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by
            separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services
            Agreement at <a href="https://aka.ms/msa">https://aka.ms/msa</a>.
            You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service
            terms of use or the app’s settings, as applicable; please read them.
            The services may not be available in all regions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer may include
            additional apps, which will be subject to separate license terms and
            privacy policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            The software may include third-party programs that are licensed to
            you under this agreement, or under their own terms. License terms,
            notices and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party programs
            can be viewed at C:\Windows\Help\en-US\credits.rtf.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2. Installation and Use Rights</h2>
        <h3>a. License</h3>
        <p>
          The software is licensed, not sold. The software license is
          permanently assigned to the device with which you acquired the
          software. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and
          run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device),
          so long as you comply with the terms and restrictions contained in
          this agreement. Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with
          software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your
          original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that
          situation, you do not have a license to use the software.
        </p>

        <h3>b. Device</h3>
        <p>
          In this agreement, “device” means a physical hardware system with an
          internal storage device capable of running the software, or a virtual
          machine. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a device.
        </p>

        <h3>c. Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          The device manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all rights
          (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly
          granted in this agreement, and no other rights are licensed to you.
          For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not give you any right
          to, and you may not (and you may not permit any other person or entity
          to):
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>use or virtualize features of the software separately;</li>
          <li>
            publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease,
            or lend the software;
          </li>
          <li>
            transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);
          </li>
          <li>
            work around any technical restrictions or limitations in the
            software;
          </li>
          <li>
            use the software as server software or to operate the device as a
            server, except as permitted under Section 2(d)(iii) below; use the
            software to offer commercial hosting services; make the software
            available for simultaneous use by more than one user over a network,
            except as permitted under Section 2(d)(vi) below; install the
            software on a server for remote access or use over a network; or
            install the software on a device for use only by remote users; a
            single device may be locally and simultaneously interacted with by
            up-to two end user operators;
          </li>
          <li>
            reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt
            to do so, except and only to the extent that the foregoing
            restriction is (a) permitted by applicable law; (b) permitted by
            licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may
            be included with the software; or (c) required to debug changes to
            any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
            that are included with and linked to by the software; and
          </li>
          <li>
            when using Internet-based features you may not use those features in
            any way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to
            try to gain access to or use any service, data, account, or network,
            in an unauthorized manner.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>d. Multi-Use scenarios</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Multiple versions. If when acquiring the software, you were provided
            with multiple versions (such as 32-bit and 64-bit versions), you may
            install and activate only one of those versions at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple or pooled connections. Hardware or software you use to
            multiplex or pool connections, or reduce the number of devices or
            users that access or use the software, does not reduce the number of
            licenses you need. You may only use such hardware or software if you
            have a license for each instance of the software you are using.
          </li>
          <li>
            Device connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access
            the software installed on the licensed device solely to use the
            following software features for personal or internal purposes: file
            services, print services, Internet information services, and
            Internet connection sharing and telephony services on the licensed
            device. The 20 connection limit applies to devices that access the
            software indirectly through “multiplexing” or other software or
            hardware that pools connections. You may allow any number of devices
            to access the software on the licensed device to synchronize data
            between devices. This subsection does not mean, however, that you
            have the right to install the software, or use the primary function
            of the software (other than the features listed in this subsection),
            on any of these other devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remote access. Users may access the licensed device from another
            device using remote access technologies, but only on devices
            separately licensed to run the same or higher edition of this
            software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remote assistance. You may use remote assistance technologies to
            share an active session without obtaining any additional licenses
            for the software. Remote assistance allows one user to connect
            directly to another user’s computer, usually to correct problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            POS application. If the software is installed on a retail point of
            service device, you may use the software with a point of service
            application (“POS Application”). A POS Application is a software
            application which provides only the following functions: (i) process
            sales and service transactions, scan and track inventory, record
            and/or transmit customer information, and perform related management
            functions, and/or (ii) provide information directly and indirectly
            to customers about available products and services. You may use
            other programs with the software as long as the other programs: (i)
            directly support the manufacturer’s specific use for the device, or
            (ii) provide system utilities, resource management, or anti-virus or
            similar protection. For clarification purposes, an automated teller
            machine (“ATM”) is not a retail point of service device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloud Computing Devices. If your device uses Internet browsing
            functionality to connect to and access cloud hosted applications:
            (i) no desktop functions may run locally on the device, and (ii) any
            files that result from the use of the desktop functions may not be
            permanently stored on the system. “Desktop functions,” as used in
            this agreement, means a consumer or business task or process
            performed by a computer or computing device. This includes but is
            not limited to email, word processing, spreadsheets, database,
            scheduling, network or internet browsing and personal finance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Desktop Functions. If your system performs desktop functions, then
            you must ensure that they: (i) are only used to support the
            application, and (ii) operate only when used with the application.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>e. Specific Use</h3>
        <p>
          The manufacturer designed the licensed device for a specific use. You
          may only use the software for that use.
        </p>

        <h3>f. High Risk Use</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            WARNING: THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE WHERE
            FAILURE OR FAULT OF ANY KIND OF THE SOFTWARE COULD RESULT IN DEATH
            OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, OR IN PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
            (collectively “High Risk Use”). Accordingly, You must design and
            implement Your hardware and software such that, in the event of any
            interruption, defect, error, or other failure of the software, the
            safety of people, property, and the environment are not reduced
            below a level that is reasonable, appropriate, and legal, whether in
            general or for a specific industry. Your High Risk Use of the
            software is at Your own risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
            Microsoft from any claims, including claims arising from any High
            Risk Uses, and inclusive of attorneys’ fees, related to the
            distribution or use of Your devices, except to the extent that any
            intellectual property claim is based solely on the unmodified
            software.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Privacy; Consent to Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or
          receive information when using those features. Many of these features
          can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to
          use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree
          that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as
          described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement available at
          <a href="https://aka.ms/privacy">https://aka.ms/privacy</a>, and as
          may be described in the user interface associated with the software
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Authorized Software and Activation</h2>
        <p>
          You are authorized to use this software only if you are properly
          licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine
          product key or by other authorized method. When you connect to the
          Internet while using the software, the software will automatically
          contact Microsoft or its affiliate to confirm the software is genuine
          and the license is associated with the licensed device. You can also
          activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. In either
          case, transmission of certain information will occur, and Internet,
          telephone and SMS service charges may apply. During activation (or
          reactivation that may be triggered by changes to your device’s
          components), the software may determine that the installed instance of
          the software is counterfeit, improperly licensed or includes
          unauthorized changes. If activation fails the software will attempt to
          repair itself by replacing any tampered Microsoft software with
          genuine Microsoft software. You may also receive reminders to obtain a
          proper license for the software. Successful activation does not
          confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed. You may not
          bypass or circumvent activation. To help determine if your software is
          genuine and whether you are properly licensed, see
          <a href="https://aka.ms/genuine">https://aka.ms/genuine</a>. Certain
          updates, support, and other services might be offered only to users of
          genuine Microsoft software.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Updates</h2>
        <p>
          The software periodically checks for system and app updates, and may
          download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from
          Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your
          system to provide you with those updates. To the extent automatic
          updates are enabled on your device, by accepting this agreement, or
          using the software, you agree to receive these types of automatic
          updates without any additional notice.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Geographic and Export Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          If your software is restricted for use in a particular geographic
          region, then you may activate the software only in that region. You
          must also comply with all domestic and international export laws and
          regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on
          destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on
          geographic and export restrictions, visit
          <a href="https://aka.ms/exporting">https://aka.ms/exporting</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>
          7. Device Manufacturer and Installer Support and Refund Procedures
        </h2>
        <p>
          For the software generally, contact the device manufacturer or
          installer for support options. Refer to the support number provided
          with the software. For updates and supplements obtained directly from
          Microsoft, Microsoft may provide limited support services for properly
          licensed software as described at
          <a href="https://aka.ms/mssupport">https://aka.ms/mssupport</a>. If
          you are seeking a refund, contact the device manufacturer or installer
          to determine its refund policies. You must comply with those policies,
          which might require you to return the software with the entire device
          on which the software is installed for a refund.
        </p>

        <h2>
          8. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if You Live in (or, if
          a Business, Your Principal Place of Business is in) the United States
        </h2>
        <p>
          We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try
          for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it
          informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual
          arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under
          the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front
          of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the
          arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of
          appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations,
          private attorney-general actions, request for public injunctions, and
          any other proceeding or request for relief where someone acts in a
          representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual
          proceedings without the consent of all parties. “We,” “our,” and “us”
          includes Microsoft, the device manufacturer, software installer, and
          our affiliates.
        </p>

        <h3>a. Disputes covered—everything except IP</h3>
        <p>
          The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or
          controversy between you and the device manufacturer or installer, or
          you and Microsoft, concerning the software (or software to which this
          agreement applies including other Windows apps), its price, marketing,
          communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or this agreement,
          under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or
          regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of
          your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property
          rights.
        </p>

        <h3>b. Send a Notice of Dispute before arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a dispute that our customer service representatives can’t
          resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an
          individualized Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to the device
          manufacturer or installer, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT. If your dispute is
          with Microsoft, you must first mail it to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN:
          CELA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or submit
          the form electronically. The Notice of Dispute form is available at
          <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499"
            >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499</a
          >. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires.
          We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. Any applicable
          statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly
          submitted individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on
          which an arbitration may properly be filed under this Section 8.
        </p>

        <h3>c. Small claims court option</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the
          other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief,
          so long as the action meets the small claims court’s requirements and
          remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small
          claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business,
          your principal place of business).
        </p>

        <h3>d. Arbitration procedure</h3>
        <p>
          The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration
          Rules (or if you are an individual and use the software for personal
          or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000
          USD whether or not you are an individual or how you use the software,
          its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see
          <a href="https://aka.ms/adr">https://aka.ms/adr</a>. This agreement
          governs to the extent it conflicts with any applicable AAA rules. To
          initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form
          available at
          <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497"
            >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497</a
          >
          to the AAA and mail a copy to the device manufacturer or installer (or
          to Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft). The form must contain
          information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute
          involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by
          videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an
          in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in
          your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of
          business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you
          individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
          injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual
          claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive
          authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation,
          existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration
          agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the
          pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualized Notice of
          Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the
          prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or
          combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv)
          to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with
          this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least
          24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are
          represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating
          with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related
          Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50
          individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations
          will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch,
          each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and
          resolved in individual arbitrations under this Section 8; (ii) none of
          the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration
          until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved;
          and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to
          informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of
          Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the
          Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this
          Section 8. This process of batched individual arbitrations will
          continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or
          through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to
          enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of
          claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that
          do not comply with this paragraph.
        </p>

        <h3>e. Arbitration fees and payments</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Disputes involving less than $75,000 USD. The device manufacturer or
            installer (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will
            promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and
            arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If (i) the dispute involves less
            than $75,000 USD; and before initiating arbitration (ii) you
            complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this Section 8,
            including, if applicable, the Related Cases paragraph. Otherwise,
            the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and
            arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If, at the conclusion of the
            arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written
            offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, the device
            manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if your dispute is with
            Microsoft) will pay you: (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 USD
            (whichever is more); (ii) any reasonable attorney’s fees you
            incurred; and (iii) any reasonable expenses (including expert
            witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection
            with your individual arbitration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more. The AAA rules will govern
            payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and
            expenses.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>f. Severability</h3>
        <p>
          If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this
          Section 8 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then
          the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to
          arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or
          remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which
          case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief
          before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part
          of Section 8 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain
          in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court
          proceeding begins).
        </p>

        <h3>g. Microsoft as party or third-party beneficiary</h3>
        <p>
          If Microsoft is the device manufacturer or if you acquired the
          software from a retailer, Microsoft is a party to this agreement.
          Otherwise, Microsoft is not a party but is a third-party beneficiary
          of your agreement with the device manufacturer or installer to resolve
          disputes through informal negotiation and arbitration.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          The laws of the state or country where you live (or, if a business,
          where your principal place of business is located) govern all claims
          and disputes concerning the software, its price, or this agreement,
          including breach of contract claims and claims under state consumer
          protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for
          unjust enrichment, and in tort, regardless of conflict of law
          principles. In the United States, the FAA governs all provisions
          relating to arbitration.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Consumer Rights, Regional Variations</h2>
        <p>
          This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other
          rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or
          country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from which
          you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
          rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
          For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions,
          or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply
          to you:

          remedies you may have under law, including your rights and remedies
          under the Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees. Nothing in this
          agreement limits or changes those rights and remedies. In particular:

            installer provides the express warranty. You are entitled to a
            replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any
            other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled
            to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of
            acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major
            failure.

            such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which

            slight negligence.
